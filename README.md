# Hi!ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Connor Hackenberg, a student, and a huge HomeLab enthusiast. I am currently studying to become a network engineer or systems administrator.

You might have seen my username *(MapGuy11)* pop around The Weather Channel community as I am one of the co-developers of the website [Weatherscan.net](https://weatherscan.net/) that has allowed everyone to keep experiencing the nostalgia that was Weatherscan.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently relearning Python and coding as a whole on a college level. **Yikes!**
- ðŸŒ± I am currently studying Network & Systems Administration at Pennsylvania College of Technology.
- ðŸ“« You can find me here on GitHub in the various repositories I am a part of. If you have a specific question, please visit my [website](https://connorhackenberg.tech) for my latest contact information. *(Please note: any spam or any not legitimate emails will be ignored and destroyed)* 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like EVs and Diesel Engines. *(Crazy Right?)*
- I speak English (natively), and a little bit of Spanish.
