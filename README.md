# Hi!ðŸ‘‹
## I am a student, and a huge HomeLab enthusiast, and currently studying to become a network engineer or systems administrator.

You might have seen my username *(MapGuy11)* pop around various communities as I try to spend my time helping out with different free projects.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently developing workflows and the 24/7 stream for the Maryland-focused weather channel, TMC Weather.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently studying Network & Systems Administration at Pennsylvania College of Technology.
- ðŸ“« You can find me here on GitHub in the various repositories I am a part of. If you have a specific question, please visit my [website](https://connorhackenberg.tech) for my latest contact information. *(Please note: any spam or any not legitimate emails will be ignored and destroyed)* 
- âš¡ Fun fact: Using Public Transit is a challenge in the US, but that is the fun part about it! *(Don't we love hourly buses ðŸ˜¢)*
