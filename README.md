# Hi!ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Connor Hackenberg, a student, and a huge HomeLab enthusiast. I am currently studying to become a network egineer or systems administrator.

You might have seen my username *(MapGuy11)* pop around The Weather Channel community as I am one of the co-developers of the website [Weatherscan.net](https://weatherscan.net/) that has allowed everyone to keep experiencing the nostalgia that was Weatherscan.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on rebuilding my home lab after a successful SSD upgrade to my server.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning in a Dual Enrollment vocational course on Systems Administration before I transfer out to a different school to finish my bachelors degree.
- ðŸ“« You can find me here on GitHub in the various repositories I am apart of. If you have a specific question, please visit my [website](https://connorhackenberg.tech) for all of my latest contact information. *(Please note: any spam or any not legitimate emails will be ignored and destroyed)* 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like EV's, and Diesel Engines. *(Crazy Right?)*
- I speak English (natively), and a little bit of Spanish.
